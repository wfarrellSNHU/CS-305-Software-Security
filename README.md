# CS-305-Software-Security

Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
Artemis Financial is a financial planning institution that wanted to help their customers plan investments using a new Web appplication utilizing an API built directly themselves.  They wanted us to ensure that the web and API had no security concerns and was vulnerability free.

What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
I was able to quickly identify any vulnerabilities by their application and api by utilizing the Vulnerability diagram to focus on Input Validation, Cryptography, Code Quality and Client/Server areas of protection.

What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
The Code quality was the hardest due to reading and studying the Oracle suggested code security concerns document.  There's a lot to learn from that document and must practice using more since Java application development can use many styles of coding patterns that one to many aspects of the secutiry best practices document might touch on.

How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
By using static testing tools as well with code quality and proper client/server programming patterns I was able to make the application and API secure to use.

How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
Testing and checking results is a vital as well as writing automated testing are vital for ensuring that the application and serivces are and kept into the future secure.

What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
The OWASP security plugin as well as the Oracle Best Practices to Secure Coding were vital in making this possible.

Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
I would show the refactoring work as well as the results before and after with the OWASP static testing plugin.
